        "title": "Switch repos over from edx org shared workflows to openedx shared workflows",
        "body": "Based on a meeting of @nedbat , @feanil , and @carlosmuniz.\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n* This .github repo was copied from https://github.com/edx/.github\r\n* We copied the repo instead of moving it because certain files *should* differ between the two orgs, such as the welcome page and security policy.\r\n* Furthermore, we want a core set of `./workflow-templates` (e.g., \"upgrade requirements\") to be available in both organizations, which will require some amount of those templates to exist, duplicated, in each organization's .github repo.\r\n* However, the _implementations_ of those shared workflows (in `./.github/workflows`) are currently duplicated between each organization, which isn't great.\r\n\r\nAC:\r\n* De-duplication:\r\n  * If a shared workflow implementation is related to Open edX, then it should be defined in this repo only.\r\n  * If a shared workflow implementation is edX-specific, then it should be defined in edX's .github repo only.\r\n  * Before deleting the extraneous workflow implementations, all references to shared workflow implementations must be updated to point at the logical organization.\r\n  * Fully completing this step will also require normalizing repos that currently use a _copy_ of the shared workflow instead of reference to the shared workflow.\r\n  * Example: the definition of commitlint belongs solely in openedx's .github repo. We will need to go to every repo in the openedx organization and make sure its commitlint workflow is a pointer to the shared openedx commitlint workflow, **not** the edx commitlint workflow and **not** a copied implementation.\r\n* Each organization's' .github repo should contain all the `./workflow-templates` it needs, duplicated between orgs if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
