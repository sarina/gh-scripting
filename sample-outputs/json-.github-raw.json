We will need to go to every repo in the openedx organization and make sure its commitlint workflow is a pointer to the shared openedx commitlint workflow, **not** the edx commitlint workflow and **not** a copied implementation.\r\n* Each organization's' .github repo should contain all the `./workflow-templates` it needs, duplicated between orgs if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
